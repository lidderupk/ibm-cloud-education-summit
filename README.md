### Workshop descriptions

**Deploy and monitor machine learning models on IBM Cloud**

In the not-too-distant past, data scientists worked in silos, doing their work on desktops and sharing Python and R scripts with their peers. Now, they have tools like Watson Studio and Jupyter Notebooks that make collaboration easier online.

While it is easy to share code and dashboards with technical and non-technical folks, it is still difficult to deploy your amazing models such that others can use them hassle-free. Even after you have deployed a model, you still need to monitor it closely and re-deploy new, improved models over time.

In this hands-on workshop you will successfully create, store, and deploy a Machine Learning Model on IBM Cloud using Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning Services.

**Running Your Docker Containers in Kubernetes in IBM Cloud**

Kubernetes is an open-source software for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

The workshop will consist of two parts:
1. Overview:
* What is Kubernetes and Kubernetes fundamentals
* Docker vs. Kubernetes
2. The hands-on workshop:
* App deployment with Docker/and Kubernetes CLI
* How to use Kubernetes to automate deploying, scale and manage container-based applications

**Build three serverless applications with Apache OpenWhisk!**

Serverless computing refers to a model where the existence of servers is entirely abstracted away. Even though servers exist, developers are relieved from the need to care about their operation. They are relieved from the need to worry about low-level infrastructural and operational details such as scalability, high-availability, infrastructure-security, and other details. Serverless computing is essentially about reducing maintenance efforts to allow developers to quickly focus on developing code that adds value.

We will work through three labs in this session:
Lab1: Create, build, and run a cloud-native Node.js serverless app in less than 15 minutes
Lab2: Create, build, and run a cloud-native Python 3 serverless application that uses the Visual Recognition service to determine image content
Lab3: Create, build, and run three serverless functions as a sequence

We will use Apache OpenWhisk to run through the labs. Openwhisk is an open source, distributed Serverless platform that executes functions (fx) in response to events at any scale. OpenWhisk manages the infrastructure, servers and scaling using Docker containers so you can focus on building amazing and efficient applications.

Key concepts introduced will include triggers, rules, actions, composition and event driven architecture. Finally, serverless is relatively new and we will look at what the shortcomings are with the current technology and how to mitigate them.

### How to prepare for the workshops & prerequisites

* Bring your laptop
* For 'Running your Docker Containers in Kubernetes in IBM Cloud' workshop:
Download & test Docker. Docker for Mac or Windows (or other platforms), please visit [Docker Community Edition page](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community).

Please test your Docker installation by writing in the terminal:

`docker run ubuntu echo Hello World`

You should see "Hello World" message. That confirms the installation of the Docker is successful.
